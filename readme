I want to make a class based version of my f0 analysis code, just for some practice with classes

fits.h is the definition of classes to be used
fits.cpp creates the methods for the classes


I should make the class such that I can call a function that only takes the histograms 
and a number as an argument, and produces all the plots from there

fits.h and fits.cpp are depricated.
using primary.h and primary.cpp as the main analysis class
